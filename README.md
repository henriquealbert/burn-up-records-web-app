# Burn Up Records

## What is it?
It's a SaaS for independent artists to release their songs in all virtual stores, such as Spotify, iTunes, Beatport, and  +200 stores.
The artist has the option to use it for free and split the royalties of the song 50/50, or pay a small monthly fee to receive 100% of the royalties.
